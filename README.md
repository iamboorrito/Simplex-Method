# Simplex-Method
A learning tool that performs the simplex method.

Creates a window containing grid cells representing the input simplex tableau. There are buttons for single-step iteration, iteration to completion, resizing, and undoing. You can also exchange columns by dragging them. It's still a work in progress, so I expect bugs to arise as it gets used more.

The editor also supports common math functions through [mXparser](http://mathparser.org/).
