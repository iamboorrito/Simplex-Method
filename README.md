# Simplex-Method
A learning tool that performs the simplex method.

Creates a window containing grid cells representing the input simplex tableau. There are buttons for single-step iteration, iteration to completion, resizing, and undoing. You can also exchange columns by dragging them. It's still a work in progress, so I expect bugs to arise as it gets used more.

With the addition of Jeks, this now functions a lot like Microsoft Excel, but with a nice solver for education purposes. 

This program only uses Jeks as a library and does not make any attempt at modification. To get Jeks, visit http://www.eteks.com/jeks/en/.
